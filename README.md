So far, two data schemas are implemented for this project -- "Product" and "User". The two data entities are not related to each other for the functionality of this website.

Planned future enhancements, such as data schemas for "Ratings", "Reviews", and "Orders", will have relations to "Product" and "User".

# Unsolved Problems
- Responsive elements when browser window is resized. Right now, website does not look good in a resized window or in screen sizes smaller than a typical computer browser.
- Placing a demo order is not yet functional -- need to work on backend as well as frontend to fully implement this feature.

# Future Enhancements
- Add responsive web design
- Add Firebase/Google OAuth for login
- Add a ratings and reviews feature
- Add a testimonials page
- Add color options and sizes to products

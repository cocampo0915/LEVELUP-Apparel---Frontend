        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
        <p>We didn't just set out to make the best apparel for gamers... we set out to revolutionize the world through gaming.</p>
        <p>We're focused on creating community, opportunity and an equal map for all.

</p>
        <p>In everything we do, we think bigger and do better to impact the future for the next generation of gamersâ€”one sweatshirt at a time.</p>
        <p>From community events, to collaborations, to products, we choose quality over quantity and make sure we're elevating gaming as we do it.</p>
